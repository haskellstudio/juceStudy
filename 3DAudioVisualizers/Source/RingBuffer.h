/** A RingBuffer for multiple channels of audio. Currenly this only safely supports one reader and one writer.
    If we later add multiple readers, locks will be needed.
 
    Potentially we could make a slightly more lightweight solution using a single
    dimensional array and then just access it using arithmetic. But with compiler
    optimizations and stuff, this is probably fine.
